# easyDCP Player+ Remote Control
[easyDCP Player+](https://www.easydcp.com), powered by [Fraunhofer IIS](http://www.iis.fraunhofer.de), is the leading software for digital cinema content playback on standard PC and Mac.  
This **free and open-source** extension allows you to remotely control the easyDCP Player+ software.

*easyDCP Player+ Remote Control* consists of two software components:
- a **server application** running on the computer together with easyDCP Player+
- a **progressive web application (PWA)** running on any device in a web browser

### Server Application
The server application acts as a bridge between easyDCP Player+ and PWA.
Therefore, it must be installed on the same computer together with easyDCP Player+.  
The server application controls the graphical user interface (GUI) of the easyDCP Player+ software by simulating keyboard input and mouse click events.
Additionally, the PWA is hosted via an integrated web server.
A RESTful-API and WebSockets are used for communication between server application and PWA.

### Progressive Web Application (PWA)
For best platform compatibility the user control is implemented as a progressive web application (PWA).
You can run the PWA on any device with a modern web browser.
After the server application is running connect the PWA with the correct server IP address and port number and start controlling the easyDCP Player+ software remotely.  
Below you see some mockups of the PWA:

The PWA can run in any modern web browser on any device.  
Both devices (computer with server application and device running the PWA) must be connected to the same local network in order to communicate.
